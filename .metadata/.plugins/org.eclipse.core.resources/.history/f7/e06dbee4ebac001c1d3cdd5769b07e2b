/**
 * constuctor is used to initilize instance members of the class, Contructor is
 * similar to method but, 1. constuctor name should be same as classname 2.
 * constuctor doesn't have return type and also not returns any value 3.
 * constuctor gets called automatically when an instance/object of a class is
 * created 4. being a programmer we can't call/executed constuctor based on our
 * requirement 5. constuctor are 2 types a. default constuctor : written by java
 * compiler with empty body b. user defined constuctor : written by programmer
 * i. zero parameterized constuctor ii. parameterized constuctor
